## Introduction

This project involves coding various machine learning models from scratch in Python. It serves as an educational resource for understanding the fundamentals of machine learning.

## Implemented Models

The following models have been implemented:
- Gradient Boosting Regression Trees (GBRT)
- Bayesian Tuning Model
- Bagging Model
- Tree Models
- Neighbor Package

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathansina/machine-learning-from-scartch.git
cd machine-learning-from-scartch
```

Ensure you have Python installed. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each model can be found within its respective file. To run a specific model, execute the corresponding Python script. For example, to run the GBRT model:

```bash
python gbrt.py
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.
